# DLSite Price History

This script stores any prices you see in the script's memory and displays them the next time you view the same listing. This is a completely **local** operation. This script does not communicate with any external servers and therefore only sees the prices that you see when you visit the website.

When first launching DLSite with this script, everything you view will read as "newly recorded". It will only begin comparing prices on future visits (after a minimum of 12 hours).
